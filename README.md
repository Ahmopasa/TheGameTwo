# TheUnityGame

* This game was made by watching a course, given on Udemy, that can be found [here](https://www.udemy.com/course/unityroguelike/). The game is a 2D game and has a top-down perspective. Since I did not make this game all alone, I owe it to myself to thank [James](https://www.udemy.com/user/james-doyle-4/). Also, I would like to thank the creators of the tileset, fonts and in-game-audios/SFXs.
* This game and the one on the video mostly similar. A couple of changes has been made after finishing the course. For example, Training Area scene.
* This game is still in very early stages, which means that it does not contain many features, such as fully-functional save/load system, player inventory, player stats etc. Because these some of these features were not mentioned during the course. Therefore, I will handle them by myself.
* Since this game is the second game I made, I don't know how efficiently it was designed and how effectively the script codes were written. As a result, this game is currently in the pre-alpha phase.
* Last but not least, this game was build to run on Windows x86_64 architecture.

# Features
  * The ones in the game:
      * An basic-level implemented systems, that were used for weapons, movements and boss fights.
      * An entry-level implemented shop, that can be used to upgrade weapon.
      * There are three different levels and one boss level exist in the game. When you defeat the boss, you finish the game. In addition to that, there is a training area where the player can test different chars, weapons and face with different enemies.
      
  * The upcoming ones:
      * Polishing current levels.
      * Adjusting current boss-fighting system.
      * New in-game stories.
      * An instructor, that tells the way to play the game effectively.
      * Brand new levels, new bosses etc.

# Installation

* I haven't tested the game on other computers, but following instructions should work to run the game:
	* Download the the files inside ../Buildings/v1.0.0 and then run the "Dungeon Gunner.exe" file. If you face any trouble, try downloading the .rar in the v1.0.0 release.

# Contributing
* Currently, the release level is v1.0.0. With major patch, I'll increase the zero in middle, such as v1.1.0, v1.2.0 etc. With minor patch, I'll increase the right-most zero, such as v1.0.1, v1.0.2 etc.
* Pull requests are welcome. For major changes, please open an issue first to discuss what you would like to change.

# License
* I'm not sure how ethic it would be, but I would like to add a license, that is [MIT](https://choosealicense.com/licenses/mit/).
